Overall Accuracy:

The accuracy generally increases slightly as k increases up to k=16, where it peaks at 80.8%
This suggests that as we consider more neighbors, the classifier may become more stable and less susceptible to noise in the data.
However, for k=19 the accuracy drops slightly, indicating that too large a k value might over-smooth the decision boundary.
Precision:

Precision values for each k-value are quite close, ranging from around 0.76 to 0.80.
Higher precision means fewer false positives for the positive class (gammas). The peak precision occurs at k=4,
but it does not necessarily correlate with the highest overall accuracy. This can imply that ùëò
k=4 prioritizes correctly identifying gammas but may compromise on correctly identifying hadrons (class 0).

Recall:

Recall values tend to improve as 
k increases, reaching a maximum at 
k=19. Higher recall means more true positives are captured, especially for the positive class (gammas). This indicates that higher 
k values make the model better at identifying all gammas, possibly due to a more generalized decision boundary.
 However, this may come at the cost of increased false positives.

F1-Score:

The F1-score, which balances precision and recall, shows a slight improvement with increasing
k, peaking at
k=16 with a value of 0.823. The F1-score is a good indicator of overall model performance,
especially in cases where the classes are imbalanced. Higher
k values, up to 16, generally perform better as they balance precision and recall.

Confusion Matrix:

The confusion matrices show that as
k increases, the number of false positives (hadrons misclassified as gammas) tends to decrease slightly, while the number of false negatives (gammas misclassified as hadrons) generally decreases. 
This aligns with the improvements in recall and F1-score as
k increases, showing that larger
k-values reduce the likelihood of misclassifying gammas as hadrons.
However, at very high 
k values, such as 
k=19, the slight increase in false positives suggests that the classifier might start to lose specificity for gammas.


Optimal k-value:
k=16 seems to provide the best balance between precision, recall, and F1-score,
achieving both high recall and a stable accuracy, suggesting that this
k-value might be the best choice for this dataset.
Lower
k-values (like k=1) show a lower overall accuracy and F1-score, indicating higher susceptibility to noise and overfitting.
 This is typical for small 
k values, as they consider fewer neighbors, potentially making the model over-sensitive to the nearest points.


Conclusion:
The results suggest that for this dataset, a moderate
k value (between 10 and 16) provides a good trade-off between accuracy, precision, and recall. While
k=1 performs well in recall due to capturing more true positives, it is not as stable as higher
k values.
Overall,
k=16 might be recommended as it provides the best balance across metrics, suggesting that the model generalizes well at this setting.
